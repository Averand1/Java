Why use Generics?
-> In our example of DoublePrinter.java, IntegerPrinter.java, StringPrinter.java, Most of the code
is same other than the Data Type, there's a lot of code duplication going on just for changing the
types, to resolve this issue we use Generics

Generics don't work with primitive data types, use Wrapper Classes like String, Integer, Double
instead
