Human.java is the main class in this example, and Student.java is the subclass of the Human class
it contains the constructor to make objects with couple of properties like name, age, occupation

Student.java contains the information that the student is required to have

StudentInfo.java contains the couple of methods from which we can get names, age, etc of student

Main.Java is where we're making a MyStudent Object usign Student.java Class and setting the values
and calling some methods from StudentInfo.java
